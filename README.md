# hello-world
This is a repository created while learning how to use Github

This is something about myself.

I have jsut completed a course about Python and currently doing a course learning about Machine Learning. 

Learning GitHub is a must as it is efficient for working either alone or as a team.

I have just discovered that we can write different versions for a repository, which gives us a lot of flexibility.

I will now try to add and use GitHub for all the future projects that I do, either in Python, R or in C.

Thanks.
